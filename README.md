# OsProject1ProducerConsumer

Kevin Coran Operating Systems Project 1

The goal for this assignment is to implement a producer/consumer problem in linux using shared memory and semaphores. 

The first obstacle was setting up a programming environment. I used virtualbox to virtualize an ubuntu environment. 
The text editor that i used was visual studio code and compiled with gcc through the terminal.
